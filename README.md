## Introduction
**LNLib is a C++ NURBS Basic Algorithm Library.** <br/>These algorithms are primary referenced from [The NURBS Book 2nd Edition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-97385-7). <br/>The APIs are re-designed to make it more friendly to users.

## Features
Basic Elements:
- UV
- XYZ
- XYZW
- Matrix4d

NURBS Algorithms:
- Basis Function Computation
- Bezier/B-Spline/NURBS Curve and Surface
- Curve and Surface Decomposion
- Knot Insertion and Removal
- Knot Refinement
- Degree Elevation and Reduction
- Point and Tangent Inversion
- Curve and Surface Reverse
- Curve Transform
- Create Arc and Conic

This library is **under development.**
